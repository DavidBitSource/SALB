{"name":"SALB","tagline":"Frontend for speech synthesis using HTS voice models.","body":"# SALB\r\n\r\nThe SALB system is a frontend framework for speech synthesis using HMM based voice models built by [HTS][1].\r\nSee our Releases [here](https://github.com/m-toman/SALB/releases) and the github project page [here](https://github.com/m-toman/SALB).\r\nBuild instructions, license information and a generic readme are contained in the package.\r\nAdditional documentation can be found in the [project wiki](https://github.com/m-toman/SALB/wiki).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Facts & features:\r\nThe SALB framework \r\n   - provides a frontend to [hts_engine][1] through SAPI5, a command-line-interface and a C++ API for embedding in other applications.\r\n   - comes with an example [NSIS][2] script to aid building installer packages for distributing HTS voices as Microsoft Windows system voices.\r\n   - incorporates [flite][3] for text processing of English.\r\n   - supports other languages through the ability to load [Festival][4] format lexica and Letter-To-Sound rules (further preprocessing like number conversion can easily be added in C++).\r\n   - compiles on MS Windows (>= Vista), Linux, Android, iOS.\r\n   - includes a Visual Studio 2012 solution file for compiling the SAPI5 engine, CMake build files for everything else.\r\n   - is released under liberal/MIT-like [license][5].\r\n\r\nWe also provide a free (Austrian) German voice model of a male, professional speaker, including number conversion, a pronunciation lexicon with 14k entries and a set of Letter-To-Sound rules.\r\nListen to some samples here: [Sample 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-toman/SALB/gh-pages/samples/sample1.wav), [Sample 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-toman/SALB/gh-pages/samples/sample2.wav), [Sample 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-toman/SALB/gh-pages/samples/sample3.wav)\r\n\r\n## F.A.Q.\r\n\r\n### How can I create a new voice model?\r\nAn easy way is to use the [HTS demo packages][1].\r\nThese produce htsvoice files that can be used with the SALB system.\r\n\r\n### Why not use flite+hts_engine instead?\r\nThe SALB system is another layer on top of flite and hts_engine (see [Architecture](https://github.com/m-toman/SALB/blob/master/doc/architecture.svg)).\r\nYou might want this additional layer if:\r\n- you want the SAPI5 interface.\r\n- you would like to add a new language and/or use plain text Festival lexica and LTS rules*.\r\n- you prefer the C++ interface.\r\n- you would like to use the provided German voice model.\r\n\r\n*Of course this is also possible in flite but a bit trickier. If you would really like to do that, take a look our description on adding a new language to flite [here](http://sourceforge.net/p/at-flite/wiki/AddingNewLanguage/).\r\n\r\n### How can I contribute?\r\nWe would love to include language bindings (e.g. Python), further interfaces and more languages.\r\nOf course, bug fixes, improvements etc. are also always welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/ \"hts_engine\"\r\n[2]: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ \"NSIS\"\r\n[3]: http://www.festvox.org/flite/ \"flite\" \r\n[4]: http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/ \"Festival\"\r\n[5]: https://github.com/m-toman/SALB/blob/master/COPYING \"SALB license\"\r\n[6]: http://www.ftw.at/research-innovation/projects/salb?set_language=en \"SALB project\"\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
