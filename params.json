{"name":"SALB","tagline":"Frontend for speech synthesis using HTS voice models.","body":"# SALB\r\n\r\nThe SALB system is a frontend framework for speech synthesis using HMM based voice models built by HTS (http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/).\r\nWe also provide a free voice model of an Austrian German, male, professional speaker (see https://github.com/m-toman/SALB/releases)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Facts & features:\r\n - SAPI5: Distribute HTS voice models as Microsoft Windows system voice. An NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/) script is provided to create an installer for your system voice (x86 and x64, starting with Windows Vista).\r\n - Text analysis for English voice models by flite (http://www.festvox.org/flite/).\r\n - Synthesis by hts_engine (http://hts-engine.sourceforge.net/).\r\n - Text preprocessing for new languages can be added in C++, Lexicon and Letter-To-Sound (LTS) rules can be provided in Festival (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/) format.\r\n - Example text preprocessing as well as lexicon and LTS rules are provided for (Austrian) German.\r\n - A free Austrian German voice model of a male professional speaker is included, a voice model for a female professional speaker in Scottish English will be added soon.\r\n - Visual Studio project file for SAPI5 build.\r\n - CMake build files.\r\n - Simple command line interface for generating sound samples given text and a model file.\r\n - C++(11) API to embed in other applications.\r\n - Compiles on MS Windows, Linux, Android, iOS.\r\n\r\n## F.A.Q.\r\n\r\n### How can I create a new voice model?\r\nAn easy way is to use the demo packages on http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/.\r\nThis produces a .htsvoice file that can be used with the SALB system.\r\n\r\n### Why not use flite+hts_engine?\r\nCases to consider using the SALB system instead of flite+hts_engine include:\r\n- You need a SAPI5 interface.\r\n- You want to add a new language* and/or use plain text Festival lexica and LTS rules.\r\n- You prefer the C++ interface.\r\n\r\n*If you really want to do this in flite, take a look our description on adding a new language to flite here: http://sourceforge.net/p/at-flite/wiki/AddingNewLanguage/\r\n\r\n### How can I contribute?\r\nWe would love to include language bindings (e.g. Python), further interfaces and more languages.\r\nOf course, bug fixes, improvements etc. are also always welcome.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
