{"name":"SALB","tagline":"Frontend for speech synthesis using HTS voice models.","body":"# SALB\r\n\r\nThe SALB system is a frontend framework for speech synthesis using HMM based voice models built by HTS (http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/).\r\nWe also provide a free voice model of an Austrian German, male, professional speaker (see https://github.com/m-toman/SALB/releases)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Facts & features:\r\n - Distribute HTS voice models as Microsoft Windows system voice via SAPI5. An NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/) script is provided to create installers (x86 and x64, starting with Windows Vista).\r\n - Text analysis for English voice models by flite (http://www.festvox.org/flite/).\r\n - Parameter and waveform generation by hts_engine (http://hts-engine.sourceforge.net/).\r\n - Add new languages by text preprocessing in C++ and by providing lexicon and Letter-To-Sound (LTS) rules in Festival (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/) format.\r\n - Example text preprocessing as well as lexicon and LTS rules are provided for (Austrian) German.\r\n - A free Austrian German voice model of a male professional speaker is included, a voice model for a female professional speaker in Scottish English will be added soon.\r\n - Visual Studio 2012 solution file for the SAPI5 build included.\r\n - CMake build files for everything else.\r\n - Simple command line interface for generating sound samples.\r\n - C++(11) API to embed in other applications.\r\n - Successfully compiled on Windows (>= Vista), Linux, Android, iOS.\r\n\r\n## F.A.Q.\r\n\r\n### How can I create a new voice model?\r\nAn easy way is to use the demo packages on http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/.\r\nThese produce htsvoice-files that can be used with the SALB system.\r\n\r\n### Why not use flite+hts_engine instead?\r\nThe SALB system is another layer on top of flite and hts_engine (see https://github.com/m-toman/SALB/blob/master/doc/architecture.svg).\r\nYou might want this additional layer if:\r\n- you want the SAPI5 interface.\r\n- you would like to add a new language and/or use plain text Festival lexica and LTS rules*.\r\n- you prefer the C++ interface.\r\n- you would like to use the provided German voice model.\r\n\r\n*Of course this is also possible in flite but a bit trickier. If you would really like to do that, take a look our description on adding a new language to flite here: http://sourceforge.net/p/at-flite/wiki/AddingNewLanguage/.\r\n\r\n### How can I contribute?\r\nWe would love to include language bindings (e.g. Python), further interfaces and more languages.\r\nOf course, bug fixes, improvements etc. are also always welcome.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
